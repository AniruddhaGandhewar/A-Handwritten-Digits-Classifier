# A-Handwritten-Digits-Classifier
In this project we evaluate the effeciveness of Deep Feedforward Neural Networks for classifying images. We test the accuracy of Neural Networks with increasing number of hidden layers and neurons. Our test results fall in line with the literature about deep neural networks for Computer Vision. Having more layers and more neuron tends to improve the network's performance.
